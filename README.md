### Download the file, . I have calculated the mean for "working employees" and "employees left" in all columns(i.e., satisfaction_level, last_evaluation, etc.). Then, I drew the heatmap with the mask. Which shows the satisfactional_level is low.

#### As we can see from the above map, we can say that the region with red(left,satisfaction_level) shows that is why most employees left. The color red represents the -ve value in the correlation matrix, which means people have less satisfaction level, and also other areas like work accidents. These are the areas that were dark in the "left" column. So, satisfactional_level and work_accident are the main reasons for the best and most experienced employees to leave prematurely.
